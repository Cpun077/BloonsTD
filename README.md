# BloonsTD
Python recreation of Bloons Tower Defense(multiplayer)

Multiplayer currently semi working.
Run instructions:

1. Go to the network folder and run "python3 server.py"

2. In the root directory, run "python3 run.py" 2 times so that server detects 2 clients in queue and starts a game.

# Current TODOS:

1. Towers don't rotate on the opponent side
2. A lot of UI is not complete(name, opponent health bar)
